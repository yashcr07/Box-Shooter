Box Shooter
===

Your aim is to earn points by shooting the boxes falling down from the sky
using your mouse as you move on a 3D platform. There is a countdown
timer, which ends the game when it hits zero. The boxes themselves are
timed, which causes them to dissappear after some time if you don't shoot
them fast enough. There are three kinds of boxes:

- a regular blue box which gives points,
- a red penalty box, and
- a time box which extends the countdown timer.

The game is built on the Unity3D game engine, written in C# in Visual Studio.
